# Telegram Message Scheduler Bot (Jack)

Jack is a Telegram Bot developed using Typescript. His purpose is to provide an enviroment to store messages (announcements, reminders, etc) and broadcast them among registered groups.

## Installation

Jack is made with `Typescript`, so `Node.js` is used to deal with initialization and dependencies. The version of node used is `v14.16.1` with npm version `v6.14.12`.
Project dependencies can be installed with command:

```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration

The configuration of the bot is made by environment variables, with can be manually inserted (in case of Linux with `export` command) or using a `.env` file. The variables required are the following:

- BOT_TOKEN: The Token generated by the `Telegram Bot Father`
- DATABASE_URL: The URL used to connect to the database (required by prisma)
- PORT: The port in which the server will be listening 

## Initialization

The initialization may be performed in two different ways, either by compiling the Typescript code (which by tsconfig.json outDir will be compiled to `dist` folder) with the following command:

```bash
npx tsc
node dist/index.js
```

Or it can be done with the dependency `ts-node-dev` that starts a server to monitor the project files, restarting the application with any changes applied and saved to files. The dependency can be used in the following command:

```bash
npx ts-node-dev src/index.ts
```
